# Chapter 2: Pointer Manipulation
Pages 11-

- In C, for any type T we can form a corresponding type for the variables that contain addresses in
memory where objects of T reside
- Point to object, called 'pointers'
- Very powerful and easy to misuse, create buggy unpredictable software, etc
- This chapter covers:
  - Pointer fundamentals
    - Best methods for comprehension
    - Avoiding dangling pointers
  - Storage allocation
    - Process of reserving space in memory
  - Aggregates and pointer arithmetic
    - In C, aggregates are structures and arrays
    - Arithmetic defines rules with which calcuations on pointers are performed
    - Pointers to structs important for building data structures
