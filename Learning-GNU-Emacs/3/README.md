# Chapter 3: Search and Replace

## Different Kinds of Searches
- Emacs has a ton of search modes
  - Simple search: Give emacs a string and it will show you it's next occurance
  - Incremental search: Emacs searches as you type the string, from the first char
  - Word search: Like simple search but only matches total word/phrase matches
  - Regular Expression search: A complex way to search for strings
  - Incremental Regular Expression Search: Incremental + Reg Esp
- Offers a few search-replacement options
  - Simple search and replace: Give emacs a string all it replaces them with the other
  - Query-replace: Like simple search/replace but it asks you for each replacement
  - Regular expression replace: Use Reg Esp to replace strings

## Incremental Search
- C-s to start search, Enter to end
  - Press C-s to find next occurance
- C-r to start search backwards
  - Can interchange C-s and C-r once search is started

## Simple Searches
- C-s Enter to start search
- C-r Enter to start backwards
