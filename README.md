# Book Notes
by Thomas Ring

This repository includes notes from books I have read starting May of 2016. All
notes are in markdown format and sorted by chapter. Some have large collections
such as shortcuts for the Emacs book.

Here are the included books:
- Learning GNU Emacs
- Mastering Algorithms with C
- Programming JavaScript Applications
- Head First Android Development
