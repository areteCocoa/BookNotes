<h1 id="how-to-use-this-book-intro">How to Use This Book: Intro</h1>
<ul>
<li>This book is about keeping you engaged so you remember everything</li>
<li>Always trick yourself into thinking that the material in the book is &quot;Really Important&quot;, like a tiger</li>
<li>Two ways of remembering something:</li>
<li>Dully look at something over and over with repetition</li>
<li>Use stimulation to make brain remember faster</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-learn-the-best">How to learn the best</h2>
<ul>
<li>Here's what YOU (the reader) can do to bend your brain into submission</li>
</ul>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Slow down. The more you understand, the less you have to memorize</li>
<li>Do the exercises, write your own notes
<ul>
<li>Use a pencil and do the workouts</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Read 'Ther are No Dumb Questions'
<ul>
<li>Don't skip sidebars; they're not optional, they're a part of the core content</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Make this the last thing you read before bed. Or at least the last challenging thing.</li>
<li>Talk about it. Out loud.</li>
<li>Drink water. Lots of it.</li>
<li>Listen to your brain.
<ul>
<li>If you're starting to skim or not retain anything, take a break (but don't stop!)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Feel something (about the content of the book)</li>
<li>Write a lot of code!
<ul>
<li>You won't learn anything if you don't write any of the code!</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="read-me">Read me</h2>
<ul>
<li>Not a reference book</li>
<li>Must be new to Android but not Java</li>
<li>Start by building an app in the very first chapter</li>
<li>Examples designed for learning</li>
<li>Activities are NOT optional</li>
<li>Are apart of the core concepts of the book, enforce</li>
<li>The redundancy is intentional and important</li>
<li>The Brain Power exercises don't have answers</li>
<li>For some there is no right answer</li>
<li>For others, you decide if and when your answer is right</li>
</ul>
