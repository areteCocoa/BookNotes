# How to Use This Book: Intro

- This book is about keeping you engaged so you remember everything
- Always trick yourself into thinking that the material in the book is "Really
Important", like a tiger
- Two ways of remembering something:
  - Dully look at something over and over with repetition
  - Use stimulation to make brain remember faster

## How to learn the best
- Here's what YOU (the reader) can do to bend your brain into submission
  1. Slow down. The more you understand, the less you have to memorize
  2. Do the exercises, write your own notes
     - Use a pencil and do the workouts
  3. Read 'Ther are No Dumb Questions'
     - Don't skip sidebars; they're not optional, they're a part of the core
     content
  4. Make this the last thing you read before bed. Or at least the last
  challenging thing.
  5. Talk about it. Out loud.
  6. Drink water. Lots of it.
  7. Listen to your brain.
     - If you're starting to skim or not retain anything, take a break (but
     don't stop!)
  8. Feel something (about the content of the book)
  9. Write a lot of code!
     - You won't learn anything if you don't write any of the code!

## Read me
- Not a reference book
- Must be new to Android but not Java
- Start by building an app in the very first chapter
- Examples designed for learning
- Activities are NOT optional
  - Are apart of the core concepts of the book, enforce
- The redundancy is intentional and important
- The Brain Power exercises don't have answers
  - For some there is no right answer
  - For others, you decide if and when your answer is right
